# tgt
a small bit of UI that describes your target. this is primarily built for me, a
RDM main. it's intended to be used in conjunction with `me`, but can be used
independently if you really want.

## usage
`/tgt line` toggles a blank line at the top - I include this to keep a clean
connection to the `me` window without cluttering it too much.

`/tgt status` will toggle the status bar at the bottom. that attempts to display
a very condensed list of status effects that afflict your target. some people
prefer addons like `timers` for this, but this is less noisy.

## todo
- hide when map is open
- hide status information on friendly/non-applicable characters
- show job-specific statuses (bard should see their own songs, for example)
- incorporate `mobDb`/`ibar` information
- add a toggle to show aforementioned information
