# wheel
gavlan wheel, gavlan deal

## usage
it's a one-button ninja wheel thing:
- left-clicking an icon will cast that spell at Ni
- right-clicking an icon will cast that spell at Ichi
- `/wheel ichi|ni|san` will cast the 12 o'clock spell at the given level
- `/wheel lock` will disable click-to-drag
- `/wheel unlock` will enable click-to-drag

## todo
- why's it not in `xitools` proper? because it breaks conventions and also i'm bad
- allow configuring the left-/right-click levels
- allow configuring the level that fades when on cooldown
- show all level recast timers (allow hiding unlearned?)
