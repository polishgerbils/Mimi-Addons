# minimap-helper
are you tired of having to type out the zoom value every time you change zones?
me too, so using this just splat a value for you.

## usage
load it and forget it. i was having trouble with getting the settings to save,
so i just have it default to vaguely-appropriate values with no configuration.
you can change those if you'd like by tweaking the `minimap-zones.lua` values.
