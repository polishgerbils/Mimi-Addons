# minimap-helper
are you tired of having to type out the zoom value every time you change zones?
me too, so using this will remember your choices and automatically set the zoom.
each zone defaults to 0.5 until i can collect a more useful set of values.

## usage
`/mmh 0.16` will set the minimap zoom for the current zone to 0.16 and it will
remember that selection for the future. please note, this won't detect any zoom
values set through `/minimap` itself.
