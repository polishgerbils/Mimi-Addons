are you tired of having to type out the zoom value every time you change zones?
me too, so using this just splats a value for you.

## usage
zones will default to a scale of `0.5`, if this offends you just change it in
the code.

`/mmh <scale>` will save a zoom scale to your character config and auto-apply it
the next time it sees you in that zone
