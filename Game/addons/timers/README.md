# Timers for Ashita v4

This addon displays visual timers with progress bars for recasts, status effects, and debuffs on a target.

It is completely configurable allowing the user to customize colors, sizes, whether or not icons are used, and much more.

### Notes:
- Icons for the recast panel are currently unimplemented, and may never be implemented.  It really depends on whether I can find or create an icon pack that I like.
- This is beta software.  There will be bugs and unimplemented abilities.  I am unable to test every ability and spell for every job.  If you find something that isn't working as it should be, please report it via the issue tracker.

### Screenshots:
- Each panel is indvidually configurable
